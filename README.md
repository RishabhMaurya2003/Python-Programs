Welcome to My GitHub Repository!

This repository showcases a diverse collection of Python programs, developed during my academic journey and personal projects. As a recent graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from Rizvi College of Engineering, University of Mumbai, and currently pursuing an M.Tech at K.J. Somaiya College of Engineering, I have cultivated a strong foundation in Python programming, machine learning, data science, and more.

Some of the key projects in this repository include:

A* Algorithm: Implemented the A* pathfinding algorithm for efficient route navigation, demonstrating problem-solving skills in optimization.
Disaster Drone Pathfinding: Developed a drone navigation system using A* and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithms for disaster-stricken areas, showcasing the intersection of AI and real-world applications.
Book Recommendation System: Built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering to suggest books based on user preferences.
Image Operations: Worked with image processing tasks using Python libraries, demonstrating practical computer vision applications.
Movie Recommendation System: Developed a content-based recommendation system for movies using machine learning techniques to improve user experiences.
Q-learning: Implemented Q-learning for reinforcement learning, solving real-world decision-making problems through AI.
Twitter Analysis: Performed sentiment analysis on Twitter data, extracting insights from social media using natural language processing (NLP).
[Recommendation System Using Amazon Reviews](recommender_system_using_amazon_reviews (1).ipynb): Built a recommendation system based on user reviews from Amazon, leveraging text analysis and machine learning algorithms.
Hybrid Recommendation System: Combined collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to create a hybrid recommendation system for more accurate predictions.
[MD5 Hashing Algorithm](MD5_HASH _CSS_EXP5.ipynb): Implemented an MD5 hashing algorithm for encryption and security, showcasing my understanding of cryptography and security protocols.
These projects reflect my passion for utilizing Python and AI techniques to solve real-world challenges, and I am always eager to collaborate on new and innovative projects.

Feel free to explore these projects, provide feedback, and join me in building impactful solutions that push the boundaries of technology. Let's learn, grow, and create together!
